# 💙 Thank you for your support 💚

You just helped me to create and code more beautiful designs in the future! ✨ You are awesome! 🌟

# Project Structure

The project is organized:

        index.html - this is the main entry point
        assets/ - contains all the images
        styles.base.css - contains all the basic styles
        all other style.*.css - contains all the other styles
        app.js - main entry point to the JS code
        all other app.*.js - contains feature-specific code

# Startup

You need to have `node.js` installed on your system. If this is the case, first run this to install the `serve` package:

    npm install

Running the following command will serve the page locally:

    npm start

The page should then be reachable through [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
